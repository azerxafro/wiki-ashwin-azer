# Wikipedia Submission - IP Block Bypass Guide

## 🚫 Problem: IP Address Blocked

Wikipedia blocks certain IP ranges (VPNs, shared IPs, abuse-flagged ranges). Here are **legitimate workarounds**:

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Request Unblock (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Appealing_a_block
2. Click "Request an unblock"
3. Fill the form explaining:
   - You're a legitimate user
   - You want to create an article (not vandalism)
   - Your IP may be shared/VPN

---

## ✅ Solution 2: Use Mobile Data (Different IP)

1. **Disconnect from WiFi**
2. Use your **phone's mobile data** (4G/5G)
3. Open Wikipedia in browser
4. Create account and submit article
5. Mobile carrier IPs are rarely blocked

---

## ✅ Solution 3: Different Network Location

- Use a friend's WiFi
- Public library
- Coffee shop WiFi
- University/school network

---

## ✅ Solution 4: Create Account First

If you can access Wikipedia at all (even read-only):

1. Create an account: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount
2. Wait 4 days (autoconfirmed status)
3. Autoconfirmed users have fewer restrictions
4. Then submit via Articles for Creation

---

## ✅ Solution 5: Request Account Creation

1. Go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Request_an_account
2. Request an account be created for you
3. Wikipedia admins can create accounts for blocked IPs
4. Explain your legitimate editing purpose
